### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on porting Scott Adam's games from 1978-1985 to the Gigatron computer. 
As they are completed I will post the executable in this forum.
Eventually I will post the GTBasic code for the main engine along with instructions for using the data files that are available.
